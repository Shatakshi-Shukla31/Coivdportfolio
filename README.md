# COVID-19 Data Exploration Project
This project is a deep-dive analysis of global COVID-19 data using SQL. It focuses on understanding the spread of the virus, its impact on populations, and the progress of vaccinations around the world. The goal is to derive meaningful insights from real-world datasets and showcase SQL data handling capabilities.

# 📁 Dataset
